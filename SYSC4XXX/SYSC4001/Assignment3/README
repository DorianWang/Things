To compile the two programs:
make all

The server may be executed with ./SERVER, the client ./CLIENT
The server accepts 4 commands: append, delete, remove and search.
The command and the text associated with it must be separated with one space (only).
Currently, the deletion command still leaves an extra space where the word was, which may complicate removal of sentences.
The removal of sentences and command words are case sensitive, but word searching is not.
