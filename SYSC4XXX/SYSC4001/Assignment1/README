How to compile and run this program:

   For only the mandatory test case, run "make mandatory" followed by "./MMULT".

   For the mandatory case and an additional 5 cases, just run "make" followed by "./MMULT"

   If you only want the additional cases, run "make extra" followed by "./MMULT"



I would also like to thank the nerds on stackoverflow and other sites
for providing various solutions of sometimes dubious quality.
