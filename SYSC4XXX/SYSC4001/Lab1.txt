Q1
ls lists items in the current directory
ls -a lists all items, including hidden (special?) files/folders
ls -l lists the permisions, latest change date, owner & group and size in bytes, for all items from ls

Q2
ls dirname acts as if you called ls while dirname was the current directory, while cd dirname changes the current directory to dirname if possible.

Q3
cd ~ acts like cd /home/CURRENTUSER
cd ~username acts like cd /home/USERNAME
cd - changes the current directory to the last active directory, kinda like back button

Q4
mkdir makes a folder, but fails if the folder path is incomplete
mkdir -p will create any parent directories as required to complete the path of the new folder

Q5
The use of the two commands "cp a b" and "rm a" will emulate "mv a b". I guess you could also use "cat a > b" instead of "cp a b".
