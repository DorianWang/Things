CPython makes the Threading module not actually run more than one instruction at a time, but the Multiprocessing module

IO bound and only needs the second thread for that.

How does the server sync work?
First the server loads up everything it needs, including the current reservations.txt file.
It then sends a message into the network stating its current database hash. All listening servers will check to see
if the new server is up to date, and try to send the required messages for it to be caught up.
